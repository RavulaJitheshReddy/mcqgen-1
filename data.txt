Lists in Python
A built-in data type that stores set of values
marks = [87, 64, 33, 95, 76]
It can store elements of different types (integer, float, string, etc.)
student = [”Karan”
, 85,
“Delhi”] #student[0], student[1]..
#marks[0], marks[1]..
student[0] =
“Arjun” #allowed in python
len(student) #returns length

List Slicing
list_name[ starting_idx : ending_idx ] #ending idx is not included
Similar to String Slicing
marks = [87, 64, 33, 95, 76]
marks[ 1 : 4 ] is [64, 33, 95]
marks[ : 4 ] is same as marks[ 0 : 4]
marks[ 1 : ] is same as marks[ 1 : len(marks) ]
marks[ -3 : -1 ] is [33, 95]

List Methods
list.append(4) #adds one element at the end
list = [2, 1, 3]
list.insert( idx, el ) #insert element at index
list.sort( ) #sorts in ascending order
list.reverse( ) #reverses list
list.sort( reverse=True ) #sorts in descending order
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 1, 3, 4]
[3, 2, 1]
A
[3, 1, 2]

List Methods
list.remove(1) #removes first occurrence of element
list = [2, 1, 3, 1]
list.pop( idx ) #removes element at idx
[2, 3, 1]

Tuples in Python
A built-in data type that lets us create immutable sequences of values.
tup = (87, 64, 33, 95, 76) #tup[0], tup[1]..
tup[0] = 43 #NOT allowed in python
tup1 = ( )
tup2 = ( 1, )
tup3 = ( 1, 2, 3 )
Apna College
Tuple Methods
tup.index( el ) #returns index of first occurrence
tup = (2, 1, 3, 1)
tup.count( el ) #counts total occurrences tup.count(1) is 2
tup.index(1) is 1

Let‘s Practice
WAP to ask the user to enter names of their 3 favorite movies & store them in a list.
WAP to check if a list contains a palindrome of elements. (Hint: use copy( ) method)
[1, 2, 3, 2, 1] [1,
“abc”
,
“abc”
, 1]
